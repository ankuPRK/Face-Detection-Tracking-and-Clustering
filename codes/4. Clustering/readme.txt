Clustering: 

is done in Python. Copy the folders generated in step3 and paste them where the Python files are.

If features are generated using "avg_img_features.cpp", run "Clustering_basic_feats.py" results will be stored in "resultsAVG/"

If features are generated using "3D_track_features.cpp", run "Clustering_adv_feats.py" results will be stored in "results/"
